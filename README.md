# Fine-grained Humor Classification with Active Learning

### Incongruity

The essence of the laughable is the incongruous, the disconnecting of one idea from another (Paulos, 2008)
> A clean desk is a sign ofa cluttered desk drawer

### Ambiguity
Ambiguity occurs when the words of the surface sentence structure can be grouped in more than one way, thus yielding more than one associated deep structures.

> Did you hear about the guy whose whole left
side was cut off? Heâ€™s all right now.

### Interpersonal Effect

> Your village called. They want their Idiot back.

### Phonetic Style

> What is the difference between a nicely dressed
man on a tricycle and a poorly dressed man on a bicycle? A tire.
